# Almost ðŸ™‚ â€” but let me clarify how the key exchange usually works, depending on **who is sending data to whom**.

### ðŸ”‘ Public / Private Key Basics

* Each participant in RSA has a **public key** (shared openly) and a **private key** (kept secret).
* Data encrypted with a **public key** can only be decrypted with the matching **private key**.

### ðŸš€ Typical Hybrid RSA + AES Exchange

Letâ€™s say **a user wants to send encrypted data to a server**:

1. **Server generates RSA key pair**:

   * Public key (shareable)
   * Private key (kept secret)

2. **Server shares its public key** with users (e.g., via a certificate like in HTTPS).

3. **User generates a random AES session key** locally.

4. **User encrypts the AES key with the serverâ€™s RSA public key**.
   (Now only the server can decrypt it, since only it has the private key.)

5. **User encrypts the actual data with AES** using that session key.

6. **User sends**:

   * RSA-encrypted AES key
   * AES-encrypted data

7. **Server uses its RSA private key** to recover the AES key, then decrypts the data with AES.

### âš¡ Key Point

* The **user does NOT send their own public key** in the usual client â†’ server encryption case.
* Instead, the **serverâ€™s public key** is sent to the user, and the user uses it to protect the AES session key.

This is exactly how HTTPS/TLS works when your browser connects to a secure website.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to walk through how it works the other way around (server sending encrypted data back to the user)?
